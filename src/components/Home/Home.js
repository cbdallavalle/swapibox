          It is a period of civil war. 
          Rebel scum spaceships, striking from a hidden base, 
          have won their first and only victory 
          against the great Galactic Empire. During the battle, 
          Rebel scum spies managed to steal secret plans to the 
          Empire’s ultimate weapon, the DEATH STAR, an armored space 
          station with enough power to destroy an entire planet.

          Pursued by the Empire’s finest agents, 
          Princess Leia flees home aboard her starship, 
          custodian of the stolen plans that can enslave that rebel scum 
          and restore order to the galaxy…
