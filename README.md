## Synopsis

This project was designed to make us comfortable making multiple nested fetch calls with asynchronous javascript. The project guidelines can be found (here)[http://frontend.turing.io/projects/swapi-box.html] and was built in React and React-Router. The (Star Wars Api)[https://swapi.co/documentation] was used to display information about the characters, planets and vehicles in the show on a dynamic website. A complete testing suite in Enzyme and Jest is included.

## Code Example

Upon landing on the home page, a user sees the film crawl from the first movie in the Galactic Empire's perspective. The user can then click on one of the three buttons and see information about the people, the planets and the vehicles. Users can target people or planets and see them in the 'targets' page.

## Motivation

I had fun building the design from the Empire's perspective. To be clear though, I'm a rebel through and through.

## Installation

Clone the repo

For the frontend: ```npm install``` ```npm start``` - make sure to run the frontend server at localhost:3000

To run the tests: ```npm test```

## API Reference

The Star Wars Api is a free databse that provides data in JSON. The documentation is clear and easy to understand.

## Tests

Tests were written in Jest and Enzyme.
